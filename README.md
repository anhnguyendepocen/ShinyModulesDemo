# ShinyModulesDemo

In appOriginal.R we create a simple app that involves quite a bit of code replication. In appModules.R we refactor the application to use Shiny Modules.

The code is available on Github: https://github.com/slopp/ShinyModulesDemo

A live demo is available: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/seanlopp/ShinyModulesDemo/

To view a direct comparison of the two files open up a pull request where I've committed the changes in app_module.R to app.R.
